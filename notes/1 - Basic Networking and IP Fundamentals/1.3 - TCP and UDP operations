understanding TCP

physical connections
- packts arrive in the order they were sent
- reliable

TCP is connection-oriented
- simulates a physical connection 
- sequence numbers and acknowledgments
provide reliabiliy and order

How does TCP ensure a logical
point-to-point connection?
- sequence numbers 
- reassembly ensures that the packts are kept in
 original order

 SYN = synchronize the sequence numbers.
 ACK = acknowledges that the received packet
 is valid

 TCP retransmission
 - if the sender does not receive an ACK,it will retransmit the packet

 TCP windowing
 - regulates the flow of packets to reduce packet loss

 TCP windowing and window scaling 

 TCP windowing 
 - host can't process packet as quickly as it receives them
 - unprocessed packet are stored in a receive buffer
 - when receive buffer is full, new packet dropped

  TCP windowing synchronize
  the amount of bytes ahost will send before it stop and waits for 
  an ACK from the receiver

   TCP windowing scaling(RFC 1323)
   - multiplies the TCP window synchronize
   - maximum effective window size is 2^30 bytes or about
   1 gigabyte

   TCP global synchronization

   TCP global synchronization
   - occurs when multiple TCP connections drop packets
   - network failure
   - packets getting tail-dropped

   TCP connections start with each host sending a small
   amount of data at a time.

   maximum segment size(MSS)
   the largest chunk of data that can be sent in a single
   TCP packet.

   TCP MSS
   - MSS=MTU-TCP/IP headers
   - ethernet MTU = 1500 bytes
   - TCP/IP headers = 40 bytes
   - MSS= 1500-40 =1460 bytes
